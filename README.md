# receive_file_intent

This is a fork of the original plugin form KasemJaffer. So thanks to him for the good work.

It changes the complete file handling, to accept any type of file instead of only some types.
Every file is handled the same way.
It is copied to the app group storage and the file path is shared into the app to be accessible within flutter.

A flutter plugin that enables flutter apps to receive sharing photos, text and urls from other apps.

Also, supports iOS Share extension and launching the host app automatically. 
Check the provided example for more info.
